    "#### Downloading Rosetta\n",
    "\n",
    "Downloading Rosetta is a non-trivial task due to the shear size of the Rosetta software (40GB as a tar file). However, the submit node on OSG only allows 50GB of space, making downloading Rosetta on the submit node very difficult (since it needs to be untarred leading to 80GB of needed space). To account for this issue, we will submit a job to OSG that has the proper disk space. This job will download the full version of Rosetta, then transfer relevant functions and data from Rosetta 3.14 (if you wish to change the version of rosetta to download look to `condor/rosetta/run.sh` and change the Rosetta `tar.b2z` file to download) which are relevant for FastRelax. Finally, it will encrypt Rosetta and break it up into multiple files under 1GB in size to make the software compliant to run on the Open Science Grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This code may take a few hours to run as the downloading, untarring, and encrypting of Rosetta can take some time. However, after submitting the job you are free to close this window and come back later as long as you check the rosetta job is running with the `job_status()` function. You can not contineu onto step 3 without downloading Rosetta properly. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**<span style=\"color:red\">NOTE</span>**: By downloading Rosetta you are subject the Rosetta Licensing agreement: [link](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/rosetta/blob/main/LICENSE.md). The most important point is that the free version of Rosetta can only be used for **non-commercial** purposes. If you wish to use Rosetta for commercial purposes please consult the Licensing agreement.\n",

    "This function submits the Rosetta Relax job to the Open Science Grid. After running this, you should be able to run `job_status()` and see that your job is likely `Running`. Longer proteins with many variants (>1M) will typically take the longest to complete (>24 hours). But this a loose speculation aimed to help the user get an idea of how long each run will take, run times can and will differ substantially between proteins. Our recommendation is to start small, will 100 variants, get a feel for how long it takes to run. Then go back and start a new Rosetta relax run with the number of variants which you wish to pretrain your METL model with.  "
