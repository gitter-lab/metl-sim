# Running the Metl-Sim Jupyter notebook on the Open Science Pool 

The notebook `run_metl_sim.ipynb` allows users to a run Rosetta's Fast Relax energy function on the open science pool for users with limited coding experience on their own protein of interest. 

Please refer to this video for detailed instructions on how to set-up and run the notebook. Below are the steps to begin running the notebook. We highly recommend following the video for unexperienced users to the the addition of a visual component. 

1. Create an account on the [Open Science Pool](https://portal.osg-htc.org/application)
2. Launch an OSPool instance through Jupyter Lab [here](https://portal.osg-htc.org/documentation/htc_workloads/submitting_workloads/jupyter/).
3. Clone the github repository to the OSPool instance.
4. Open the IPython notebook `run_metl_sim.ipynb` and begin. (For more advanced users: you do not need create a new conda, the notebook will set all this up for you.)
